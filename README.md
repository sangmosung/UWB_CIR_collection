# UWB_CIR_collection v1.0

The purpose of this project is to obtain UWB CIR(Channel Impulse Response) using Qorvo's DWM3000 equipment.
The DWM3000 equipment, which is compliant with the IEEE 802.15.4z standard, ranges based on TWR communication 
between the initiator and the Responder, and simultaneously extracts the CIR.
The DWM3000 equipment can transmit CIRs to Arduino or PC. The CIR can be stored within the DWM3000 equipment or stored in Arduino, PC. 
UWB CIR collection results can also be checked in real time at the terminal.
